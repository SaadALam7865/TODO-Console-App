$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Generated tasks.md file for the Todo In-Memory Python Console Application following the spec-driven development approach. The tasks are organized in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Setup tasks for project initialization
2. **Phase 2**: Foundational tasks for core data model
3. **Phase 3-7**: User stories for each of the 5 core features:
   - US1: Add Task
   - US2: View Tasks
   - US3: Update Task
   - US4: Delete Task
   - US5: Mark Complete/Incomplete
4. **Phase 8**: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Parallel execution opportunities are identified with [P] markers. Each user story has independent test criteria to ensure testability.

## Key Outcomes

- Created complete tasks.md with 40 specific, actionable tasks
- Organized tasks by user story for independent implementation
- Included proper validation and error handling tasks
- Ensured all features can be independently tested
- Followed the spec-driven development workflow requirements
