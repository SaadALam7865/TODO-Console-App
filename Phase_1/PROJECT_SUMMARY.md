# Evolution of Todo - Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Application

## Project Status: Complete

### Overview
Successfully implemented a command-line todo manager following spec-driven development principles with Claude Code. The application supports all 5 required core features with 100% AI-generated code from specifications.

### Features Implemented
1. **Add Task**: Create tasks with title and description, with unique ID generation
2. **View Tasks**: List all tasks with ID, title, description, and completion status
3. **Update Task**: Modify title or description of existing task by ID
4. **Delete Task**: Remove task from memory by ID
5. **Mark Complete/Incomplete**: Toggle task completion status by ID

### Technology Stack
- Python 3.13+
- UV package manager
- Claude Code for AI-assisted code generation
- Spec-Kit Plus for workflow management

### Verification
- All 5 core features tested and working correctly
- Error handling implemented to prevent application crashes
- Input validation prevents invalid operations
- Console output is readable and well-formatted
- Code follows Python conventions (PEP 8 style)

### Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ All 5 basic features working correctly
- ✅ 100% of code generated by Claude Code from markdown specifications
- ✅ Complete /specs_history folder with specification documentation
- ✅ Application runs without crashes and handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Clear documentation in README.md and CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Demonstrable proof of spec-driven workflow (no manual code edits)

### Process Verification
- All code was generated from specifications following the spec-driven workflow
- No manual coding was performed - only specification refinement when needed
- Complete traceability from specification to implementation maintained
