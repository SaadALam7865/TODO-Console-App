# Claude Code Rules

This file documents how Claude Code was used to generate the Evolution of Todo - Phase I application following spec-driven development principles.

## Project Overview

The Evolution of Todo - Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Application was built using 100% AI-assisted code generation from specifications. No manual coding was performed - all implementation was generated by Claude Code from markdown specifications.

## Claude Code Interaction Process

### 1. Specification-First Workflow
- Every feature began as a detailed markdown specification in `/specs_history`
- Specifications included: feature description, acceptance criteria, technical constraints, and success metrics
- Specifications were refined iteratively until Claude Code produced correct output

### 2. Generation Process
- Claude Code generated 100% of the Python source code
- Only specification refinement was allowed (no manual code fixes)
- Multiple iterations were performed when initial specs were unclear

### 3. Tools Used
- Claude Code as the primary code generation tool
- Spec-Kit Plus for workflow management
- UV package manager for dependencies
- Python 3.13+ for implementation

## Specification Evolution

The `/specs_history` folder contains all specification iterations:
- `todo_app_spec.md` - Main specification for the Phase I application (basic features)
- `spec_10_due_dates.md` - Specification for due date functionality (intermediate feature)
- `spec_11_priorities_and_tags.md` - Specification for priority and tag functionality (intermediate feature)
- `spec_12_search_and_filter.md` - Specification for search and filter functionality (intermediate feature)
- `spec_13_sort_tasks.md` - Specification for task sorting functionality (intermediate feature)
- `spec_14_recurring_tasks.md` - Specification for recurring task automation (advanced feature)
- `spec_15_time_reminders_notifications.md` - Specification for time-based browser notifications (advanced feature)
- `intermediate_features_summary.md` - Summary of all intermediate features

## Prompts and Iterations

During development, various prompts were used to generate different components:

### Basic Features (Phase I)
1. **Initial Application Structure**: Prompts for creating the main application loop and menu system
2. **Data Model**: Prompts for defining the Task class and in-memory storage
3. **Feature Implementation**: Separate prompts for each of the 5 core features
4. **Error Handling**: Prompts for adding validation and error prevention
5. **UI/UX**: Prompts for improving console interface and user experience

### Intermediate Features (Phase I - Enhanced)
6. **Due Date Implementation**: Prompts for adding due date functionality with validation
7. **Priority and Tag Implementation**: Prompts for adding priority levels and tag categories
8. **Search and Filter Implementation**: Prompts for keyword search and multi-criteria filtering
9. **Sort Functionality Implementation**: Prompts for multiple sorting criteria and order management

### Advanced Level Implementation (Phase I - Intelligent)
10. **Recurring Tasks Implementation**: Prompts for creating recurring task functionality with pattern validation, interval management, and automatic task generation upon completion
11. **Time Reminders & Notifications Implementation**: Prompts for implementing notification system with scheduler service, reminder timing, and browser notification integration
12. **Scheduler Service Integration**: Prompts for creating background scheduler that monitors upcoming reminders and triggers notifications
13. **CLI Menu Enhancement**: Prompts for updating the command-line interface to expose advanced features through dedicated menu options (Set/View Recurring Pattern, Set/View Reminder, View Upcoming Reminders)

## Quality Assurance

- All generated code follows Python PEP 8 style conventions
- Input validation prevents application crashes
- Clear error messages guide users when invalid operations are attempted
- Console output is formatted for readability

## Constraints and Limitations

- Only in-memory storage (no persistence beyond application lifecycle)
- Console-based interface only
- Python 3.13+ required
- UV package manager required for dependencies
- Phase I scope includes 5 basic + 4 intermediate + 2 advanced features (11 total features)
- No database persistence (Phase II)
- No web interface or API (Phase II-III)
- No multi-user functionality
- No file attachments or subtasks
- Advanced scheduling and notifications implemented via browser notifications only (Phase I)
- No email/SMS notifications (Phase II-III)

## Success Metrics

- All 11 features implemented correctly (5 basic + 4 intermediate + 2 advanced)
- Application runs without crashes
- Input validation prevents errors across all features
- All functionality accessible through console interface
- Code quality meets professional standards
- Complete specification-to-code traceability maintained
- Enhanced data model accommodates new fields without breaking basic features
- User experience remains intuitive with clear prompts and formatted output
- All basic features continue working after intermediate and advanced feature additions
- 100% code generation via Claude Code from refined specifications
- Advanced features (recurring tasks, time reminders) integrate seamlessly with existing functionality
