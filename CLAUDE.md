# Claude Code Rules

This file documents how Claude Code was used to generate the Evolution of Todo - Phase I application following spec-driven development principles.

## Project Overview

The Evolution of Todo - Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Application was built using 100% AI-assisted code generation from specifications. No manual coding was performed - all implementation was generated by Claude Code from markdown specifications.

## Claude Code Interaction Process

### 1. Specification-First Workflow
- Every feature began as a detailed markdown specification in `/specs_history`
- Specifications included: feature description, acceptance criteria, technical constraints, and success metrics
- Specifications were refined iteratively until Claude Code produced correct output

### 2. Generation Process
- Claude Code generated 100% of the Python source code
- Only specification refinement was allowed (no manual code fixes)
- Multiple iterations were performed when initial specs were unclear

### 3. Tools Used
- Claude Code as the primary code generation tool
- Spec-Kit Plus for workflow management
- UV package manager for dependencies
- Python 3.13+ for implementation

## Specification Evolution

The `/specs_history` folder contains all specification iterations:
- `todo_app_spec.md` - Main specification for the Phase I application
- Additional specs may be added as requirements were refined

## Prompts and Iterations

During development, various prompts were used to generate different components:

1. **Initial Application Structure**: Prompts for creating the main application loop and menu system
2. **Data Model**: Prompts for defining the Task class and in-memory storage
3. **Feature Implementation**: Separate prompts for each of the 5 core features
4. **Error Handling**: Prompts for adding validation and error prevention
5. **UI/UX**: Prompts for improving console interface and user experience

## Quality Assurance

- All generated code follows Python PEP 8 style conventions
- Input validation prevents application crashes
- Clear error messages guide users when invalid operations are attempted
- Console output is formatted for readability

## Constraints and Limitations

- Only in-memory storage (no persistence beyond application lifecycle)
- Console-based interface only
- Python 3.13+ required
- UV package manager required for dependencies
- Phase I scope limited to 5 core features

## Success Metrics

- All 5 core features implemented correctly
- Application runs without crashes
- Input validation prevents errors
- All functionality accessible through console interface
- Code quality meets professional standards
- Complete specification-to-code traceability maintained
